# Qwen CLI Project Context

## Project Overview

Qwen CLI is an AI-powered programming assistant tool developed by Alibaba, based on the Qwen3-Coder flagship model. It's designed as a CLI agent that provides intelligent code assistance with capabilities including:

- Code review and analysis
- Automatic refactoring
- Architecture analysis
- Understanding of large software projects with ultra-long context processing
- Enhanced parsers for real-time, accurate code understanding and suggestions
- Improved programming efficiency and code quality

The project appears to be a wrapper or implementation that utilizes the @qwen-code/qwen-code NPM package, as referenced in the installation and execution instructions.

## Architecture and Technologies

- **Core AI Model**: Qwen3-Coder (Alibaba's flagship coding model)
- **Platform**: Node.js (requires Node.js 20)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript (based on NPM package usage)
- **Extension Points**: Integration with Gemini CLI framework

The project references the official Qwen Code repository at https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code as a reference implementation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20
- Python 3.8.0 (as indicated by .python-version file)
- npm package manager

### Installation Commands
```bash
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest
qwen --version
```

### Execution
```bash
qwen
```
